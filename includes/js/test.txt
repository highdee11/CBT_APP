In your own understanding, what is programming?

Programming is a way of giving the computer a set of instructions to complete a particular task.
What is the range function in python used for?

Range function in python is used to produce sequence of integer values from a specific number to the other .
Using Python, write a function that accepts a String argument and prints the reverse of the String. E.g the reverse of “reverse” should be “esrever”.

def reverse(arg):
    strLen=len(arg)
    reversed=''
    for d in range(1,len(arg)+1):
        index=int('-'+str(d))
        reversed+=arg[index]
    return reversed

Using Python, write a function that accepts a String argument and prints the String converted to uppercase.

def reverse(str):
   return str.upper()

What do you understand by function invocation?

Function invocation is calling a function with the name and parenthesis after.
Write a program in python that accepts a number between 0-9 as argument. This function should then return the word representation of the number.

def wordRepresentation(numb):
    dic={0:"Zero",1:"One",2:"Two",3:"Three",4:"Four",5:"Five",6:"Six",7:"Seven",8:"Eight",9:"Nine"}
    if numb in dic.keys(): #making sure numb is in between 0-9
        return dic[numb]

Why do you think algorithm is important?

Algorithm is important in computer programming because, your program's behaviour depends on how your algorithm is structured .
Algorithms are just like the steps of instructions given to the computer to follow
so if a step is missing or placed before its time,it can affect your entire program.
What is the difference between the List data structure and Set data structure in Python?

A list data structure can allow multiple elements of thesame values. WHILE
A set data structure will remove any element that has a values that is thesame with any of the one that is already in the set.
Example:  list=[23,44,23,23,10] => [23,44,23,23,10] i.e Nothing changed.
  set={23,44,23,23,10}=>{23,44,10}
What will be the output of this code snippet?print “I love programming”[1:-5]

 love progra
Explain encapsulation in your own words.

Encapsulation is a way of hidding data or a way of limitting the access that a user has over a particular object.
Write a function in Python that takes an argument and returns the factorial of that number.

def factorial(numb):
    if str(numb).isdigit(): #making sure numb is a digit
      fact=1
      for digit in range(1,numb+1):
        fact*=digit
      return fact
What are the sorting algorithms you’ve learnt?

selection sort
bubble sort
insertion sort
merge sort
quick  sort
Create a class RECTANGLE (in Python), this class should define a constructor that initializes two properties: length and breadth. This class should also have the following methods:- setLength(length) ------->This can be used to set the length property of the object.	getLength() ------> This can be used to retrieve the length of the object.	setBreadth(breadth) ----- This can be used to set the breadth property of the object. getBreadth() -------> This can be used to get the breadth property of the object.	calculateArea() -----> This will calculate and return the area of the rectangle object.	printArea() ------> This will calculate and print the area of the rectangle object

class RECTANGLE():
    def __init__(self):
        self.length=0
        self.breadth=0

    def setLength(self,ln):
        self.length=ln

    def getLength(self):
        return self.length

    def setBreadth(self,bth):
        self.breadth=bth

    def getBreadth(self):
        return self.breadth

    def calculateArea(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

    def printArea(self):
        print(self.length * self.breadth)

Write a function fizzbuzz , this function should take a number as an argument. The function should return “fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, but should return “buzz” if divisible by 5. If divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “fizzbuzz”.


def fizzbuzz(numb):
    if str(numb).isdigit(): #checking if numb is a digit or not
        divBy3=numb%3
        divBy5=numb%5
        if divBy3 is 0 and divBy5 is not 0:
            return "fizz"
        elif divBy5 is 0 and divBy3 is not 0:
            return "buzz"
        elif divBy5 is 0 and divBy3 is 0:
            return "fizzbuzz"
    else:
        return "argument must be a number."


Why would you like to be a software developer?

I would like to be a Software engineer because i am passionate about solving problems in my community using Information technology , i think out of the box to solve problems and this is one of the features of a  good software developer.
